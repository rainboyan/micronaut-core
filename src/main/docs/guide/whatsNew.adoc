This section covers what's new since the previous release of Micronaut.

=== Metrics Support

The first version of support for Metrics via http://micrometer.io[Micrometer] is now available. Metrics are exposed via the <<metricsEndpoint,Metrics Endpoint>> and can be extensively customized.

The first version of Metrics support includes support for Statsd, Atlas, Graphite and Prometheus with more Metrics backends coming in the future.

See the section on the <<metricsEndpoint,Metrics Endpoint>> for more information.

=== Server Sent Event (SSE) Client

A new api:http.client.sse.SseClient[] interface has been introduced that provides a client for streaming Server Sent Events (SSE) on the server. The client can also be used for testing SSE controllers.

In additional the `@Client` annotation has been updated to add support for automatically implementing streaming interfaces for both JSON and SSE streaming.

See the section on <<clientAnnotationStreaming, Client Streaming>> for more information.

=== Blocking I/O Support

It is now possible to return a api:core.io.Writable[] and have the operation offloaded to a the I/O thread pool, thus improving the ability to interface with APIs that do not yet support non-blocking I/O:

[source,java]
----
@Get(uri = "/welcome", produces = MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
Writable render() { // <2>
    return writer -> template.make( // <3>
        CollectionUtils.mapOf(
                "firstName", "Fred",
                "lastName", "Flintstone"
        )
    ).writeTo(writer);
}
----

See the section on <<serverIO, Writing Response Data>> for more information.

=== Support for OpenFaaS

Micronaut functions can now be executed from the CLI and will read from `System.in` the data required to execute a function.

This means it is possible to deploy functions developed with Micronaut to Serverless platforms that package functions within containers such as OpenFaaS, Fn etc.

The command line has also been updated with a `openfaas` feature which will create the necessary `Dockerfile` ready for deployment to OpenFaaS:

.Creating an OpenFaaS Function
[source,bash]
----
$ mn create-function foo --features openfaas
----

=== Kotlin Optional Type Support

Beans can now be injected optionally using Kotlin nullable types without the need for the `@Nullable` annotation.

=== CLI Improvements

Two new flags have been added to the `create-app` command: `lang` and `test`. 

The `lang` flag accepts any of the three supported languages: `java`, `groovy`, or `kotlin` (`java` is default when no flag is supplied). This selection will determine the language used for the `Application` class as well as other code artifacts generated using CLI commands (such as `create-controller`, `create-job`, etc).

.Creating a Groovy application
[source,bash]
----
$ mn create-app bar --lang groovy
----

.Creating a Kotlin application
[source,bash]
----
$ mn create-app baz --lang kotlin
----

The `test` flag accepts `spock`, `junit`, or `spek`. This setting will determine the test framework used by any tests generated using CLI commands (currently only `create-controller`).  Each `lang` selection includes a default test framework selection: `java`/`junit`, `groovy`/`spock`, `kotlin`/`spek`. The `test` flag allows you to override the default test framework selection.

.Creating a Java application with Spock
[source,bash]
----
$ mn create-app bar --test spock
----

.Creating a Groovy application with JUnit
[source,bash]
----
$ mn create-app baz --lang groovy --test junit
----

==== Default Dockerfile Â 

Applications generated with `create-app` now include a default `Dockerfile`. 

==== Java 9+ Improvements

The CLI has been improved to provide a better experience for Java 9 and above.
