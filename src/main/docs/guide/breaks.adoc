This section will document breaking changes that may happen during milestone or release candidate releases, as well as major releases eg (1.x.x -> 2.x.x).

==== 1.0.0.M2

* The constructor signature for DefaultHttpClient has changed to include an extra argument. This change should not impact existing uses.
* Libraries compiled against M1 are not binary compatible with M2.
* For Java 9+ automatic module name has been set to `<groupId>.<name>`. Previously if you have been using the "inject-java" module, the module is now named "io.micronaut.inject-java".
* When an HttpClientResponseException is thrown, the body of the response will be set to the exception message for responses with a text media type. Previously the status description was returned.
* Mongo configurations were updated to a new version of the driver (3.6.1 -> 3.7.1), which may break existing uses. See their link:http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.7/upgrading/[upgrading] page for more information.
* The `router` configuration key was changed to be `micronaut.router`. Static resource configuration is affected by this change. Please update your configuration: `router.static.resources` -> `micronaut.router.static.resources`.
